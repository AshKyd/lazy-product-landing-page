# Lazy product landing page

There are two hard things in computer science: putting together a landing page for the app you just built.

So I put this together based on a few landing pages I liked, it looks a little Appley (probably because of the system font stack). I'm not a designer, and put exactly half an arse into this so ymmv, but it's useful for me.
